# Outbreak_Analytics-Internship2024
During my training, I completed an internship at PCCEI lab under Mircea Sofonea. Initially focused on early metric estimation during outbreaks, my work expanded to analyzing a 'pilot intervention' â€” a short-term, early outbreak intervention using modelling approach. Then, I also explored theoretical aspects of lockdown interventions.
