# On the uncertainty in epidemiology: from estimation challenges to public health intervention evaluation

During the summer of 2024, I completed an undergraduate internship under the supervision of Mircea Sofonea at the PCCEI lab in Montpellier.
My initial focus was on exploring the biases and uncertainties in estimating key epidemiological metrics (such as serial interval and reproduction number) during the early stages of infectious disease outbreaks.
As my work progressed, it expanded to include the analysis of a 'pilot intervention' — a short-term intervention applied early in an outbreak to assess its impact — using modeling approaches.
I also conducted a deeper investigation of one of the models I developed, uncovering theoretical insights related to lockdown interventions.

This Git repository contains the final report and all related codes.
The work is organized into three main parts:

1. Regression Analysis: A simple regression analysis examining the relationship between two epidemiological parameter estimates (mean of serial interval and incubation period) for COVID-19 and the time period during which the relevant data was collected.
2. Pilot intervention study: The code allows to compute the minimum sample size required to assess the effectiveness of a lockdown intervention given a model design.
3. Model Analysis: The code proposed a detailed analysis of the model used in the pilot intervention study.
